      "What are Embeddings?\n",
      "Embeddings are dense vector representations of data in a continuous vector space. They capture\n",
      "semantic meaning and contextual relationships by mapping discrete entities (like words, sentences,\n",
      "images, or user behaviors) to points in a multi-dimensional space where similar items are positioned\n",
      "closer together.\n",
      "Unlike traditional sparse representations (like one-hot encoding), embeddings are:\n",
      "Dense: They use a fixed number of dimensions to represent information efficiently\n",
      "Learned: They're derived from data rather than manually engineered\n",
      "Continuous: They exist in a smooth vector space allowing for mathematical operations\n",
      "Semantic: They capture meaningful relationships between entities\n",
      "Real-World Example\n",
      "Consider how we might represent colors. A traditional representation might use discrete RGB values\n",
      "(255, 0, 0) for red. An embedding approach would learn that \"scarlet\" and \"crimson\" should be\n",
      "positioned close to \"red\" in vector space, while \"navy\" and \"azure\" would cluster near \"blue.\" This\n",
      "proximity in the embedding space reflects their semantic similarity.\n",
      "How Embeddings Work\n",
      "Embeddings transform discrete data into continuous vector representations through a process of\n",
      "learning from context and relationships within data.\n",
      "The Training Process\n",
      "1. Initialize: Start with random vectors for each entity (word, image, etc.)\n",
      "2. Define an objective: Create a task where predicting context is required\n",
      "For words: Predict surrounding words (Word2Vec)\n",
      "For sentences: Predict whether one sentence follows another (Sentence-BERT)\n",
      "For images: Predict whether images are similar (CLIP)\n",
      "3. Train: Update embeddings through gradient descent to minimize prediction error\n",
      "4. Extract: The resulting vectors become your embeddings\n",
      "Vector Operations\n",
      "Once trained, embeddings enable powerful vector operations:\n",
      "Similarity: Calculate cosine similarity between vectors to find related items\n",
      "Analogy: Famous example: \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" â‰ˆ \"queen\"\n",
      "Clustering: Group similar entities based on embedding proximity\n",
      "Dimensionality\n",
      "Most embedding models use vectors with dimensions ranging from 100-1024. Higher dimensions can\n",
      "capture more nuanced relationships but require more data to train effectively and more computational\n",
      "resources to use.\n",
      "Real-World Example\n",
      "Nikhil Sharma Page 102 Embeddings\n",
      "Consider a product recommendation system. When a user views a red cotton t-shirt, the system doesn't\n",
      "just recommend identical items. Instead, it:\n",
      "1. Converts the product into its embedding vector\n",
      "2. Finds other products with similar embeddings\n",
      "3. Recommends products that may differ in color or exact style but share underlying characteristics\n",
      "the user might appreciate\n",
      "The system learns these relationships from user behavior patterns rather than explicit rules.\n",
      "Use Cases of Embeddings\n",
      "Natural Language Processing\n",
      "Semantic search: Find documents based on meaning rather than exact keywords\n",
      "Text classification: Categorize documents into topics or sentiment\n",
      "Machine translation: Convert words/sentences between languages\n",

      "Content-based filtering: Recommend items similar to what users have liked\n",

      "Real-World Example\n",
      "A healthcare organization might use embeddings to:\n",
      "1. Convert patient medical records to embeddings\n",
      "2. Identify clusters of patients with similar conditions\n",
      "3. For a new patient, quickly find similar historical cases\n",
