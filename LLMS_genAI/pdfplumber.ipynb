      "What are Embeddings?\n",
      "Embeddings are dense vector representations of data in a continuous vector space. They capture\n",
      "semantic meaning and contextual relationships by mapping discrete entities (like words, sentences,\n",
      "images, or user behaviors) to points in a multi-dimensional space where similar items are positioned\n",
      "closer together.\n",
      "Unlike traditional sparse representations (like one-hot encoding), embeddings are:\n",
      "Dense: They use a fixed number of dimensions to represent information efficiently\n",
      "Learned: They're derived from data rather than manually engineered\n",
      "Continuous: They exist in a smooth vector space allowing for mathematical operations\n",
      "Semantic: They capture meaningful relationships between entities\n",
      "Real-World Example\n",
      "Consider how we might represent colors. A traditional representation might use discrete RGB values\n",
      "(255, 0, 0) for red. An embedding approach would learn that \"scarlet\" and \"crimson\" should be\n",
      "positioned close to \"red\" in vector space, while \"navy\" and \"azure\" would cluster near \"blue.\" This\n",
      "proximity in the embedding space reflects their semantic similarity.\n",
      "How Embeddings Work\n",
      "Embeddings transform discrete data into continuous vector representations through a process of\n",
      "learning from context and relationships within data.\n",
      "The Training Process\n",
      "1. Initialize: Start with random vectors for each entity (word, image, etc.)\n",
      "2. Define an objective: Create a task where predicting context is required\n",
      "For words: Predict surrounding words (Word2Vec)\n",
      "For sentences: Predict whether one sentence follows another (Sentence-BERT)\n",
      "For images: Predict whether images are similar (CLIP)\n",
      "3. Train: Update embeddings through gradient descent to minimize prediction error\n",
      "4. Extract: The resulting vectors become your embeddings\n",
      "Vector Operations\n",
      "Once trained, embeddings enable powerful vector operations:\n",
      "Similarity: Calculate cosine similarity between vectors to find related items\n",
      "Analogy: Famous example: \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" â‰ˆ \"queen\"\n",
      "Clustering: Group similar entities based on embedding proximity\n",
      "Dimensionality\n",
      "Most embedding models use vectors with dimensions ranging from 100-1024. Higher dimensions can\n",
      "capture more nuanced relationships but require more data to train effectively and more computational\n",
      "resources to use.\n",
