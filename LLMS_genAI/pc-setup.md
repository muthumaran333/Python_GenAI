1. **Install Anaconda:**

- Download Anaconda from https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
- Run the installer and follow the prompts. Note that it takes up several GB and take a while to install, but it will be a powerful platform for you to use in the future.

2. **Set up the environment:**

- Open **Anaconda Prompt** (search for it in the Start menu)
- Navigate to the "project root directory"
- be sure that `environment.yml` file is available and then,
- Create the environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- Wait for a few minutes for all packages to be installed - in some cases, this can literally take 30 minutes if you've not used Anaconda before, and even longer depending on your internet connection. Important stuff is happening! If this runs for more than 1 hour 15 mins, or gives you other problems, please go to Part 2B instead.  
- You have now built an isolated, dedicated AI environment for engineering LLMs, running vector datastores, and so much more! You now need to **activate** it using this command: `conda activate llms`  

You should see `(llms)` in your prompt, which indicates you've activated your new environment.
